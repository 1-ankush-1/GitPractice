My second PR(update repo)-
OFFTOPIC THOUGHT :
if you never created or updated file with CLI in windows os before. let me help you out use below command. 
command : echo text you want to add or append >> Name of you file
Explaination : 
echo - left side echo is used to display text in windows os. 
>> - if you want to append text in file. 
filename - at right side of >> you will put name of the file example abc.txt
